This repository contains files used in the NeuroImage paper entitled: Evidence for Age-Related Changes in Sensorimotor Neuromagnetic Responses During Cued Button Pressing in a Large Open-Access Dataset

https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neuroimage.2019.02.065

The following example scripts will generate all data related to the post-movement beta rebound. Parameters in scripts with "PMBR" in the name can be adjusted to investigate other induced responses.

Script order:

camcan_process_to_evoked_parallel.py  
camcan_run_TFR_process_parallel.py
camcan_PMBR_DICS.py
camcan_make_PMBR_ROI.py
